# TALL Course

This is my repo for the follow along to a Udemy tutorial called "Start with TALL: Use Tailwind, Alpine, Laravel & Livewire"

Got all the way to Section 6 and could not get it to work correctly. Checked the developr tools in the browser and Alpine is throwing all sorts of errors.

It seems that the newer version of Livewire (3.5.1) is not compatible with Alpine? I don't know, but it makes for a very frustrating learning experience.
